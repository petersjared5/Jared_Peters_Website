    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>A Data Analyst Fellow, I'm currently working at the Cook County Bureau of Asset Management. I got this fellowship through the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy's Applied Data Fellowship program, which is a 12-month fellowship that allows recent graduates to apply their skills in data analytics, statistics, and public policy to solve real world problems in the public and non-profit sectors. For me, I have the privilege in helping the Bureau of Asset Management, which runs all assets for the second-largest county in the U.S., make better data-driven decisions.  

        Before working for the Bureau of Asset Management, I received my Master of Science from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business in Management. I earned my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan, studying political science and history. 
        
        Outside of work and school, I love to play and watch sports (especially the Michigan Wolverines). I also love to travel, having been to all 50 U.S. states, and to learn new languages (Ich kann Deutsch sprechen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, und/y hablo un poco espaÃ±ol ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½). I also love outdoor activities, including fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and canoeing.</p>
