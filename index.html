    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>A graduate student at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, I'm a candidate for the Master of Science in Management program. In addition, I am the Vice President of Programming of the Georgetown Graduate Consulting Club (GGCC). I'm interested in pursuing a career in either data analytics or public and/or nonprofit sector(s) consulting. 

        Before coming to Georgetown, I received my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michiganâ€“Ann Arbor (Go Blue!), studying political science and history. After college, I worked in both the public and nonprofit sectors in Ann Arbor and Detroit, MI. In particular, I'm most proud of my work at Southwest Detroit Immigrant and Refugee Center, assisting recently arrived immigrants in transitioning to life in the United States. 
        
        Outside of work and school, I love to play and watch sports (especially the Michigan Wolverines). I also love to travel, having been to all 50 U.S. states, and to learn new languages (Ich kann Deutsch sprechen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, und/y hablo un poco espaÃ±ol ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½). I also love outdoor activities, including fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and canoeing.</p>
